#COSC 301 Project Group 35

##Introduction
Our project is an analysis of the exoplanets that exist outside of our solar system. This dataset comprises of some of its properties. We are interested in this data because we are fascinated about the planets that do not exist in our solar system and also possibly determine if life is possible on these planets

#Exploratory Data Analysis



#Question 1 + Results



#Question 2 + Results
##Boluwatife Yomi-Adeyemi - What are the properties of these planets and how do they rank among each other?

Trying to figure out the answer to this question, I first produced a normal table that gives me the name of the exoplanets and some of its properties. I then made a bar chart which inluded the top 10 exoplanets with the highest orbital period days. Orbital period days mean "how long it takes a planet to revolve round its star." The bar chart will be presented below:
