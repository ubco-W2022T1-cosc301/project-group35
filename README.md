### Key Questions and Specific Explorations

- Theoretical Calculation and estimation / ratio of Intelligent Vs Unintelligent Life Possibility.

- Theoretical Calculation and estimation on the amount of habitable exoplanets by ratio / percentage vs current estimated planets currently discovered.

The main key purpose of our project is to best calculate the average theoretical amount chance of exoplanet habatibility in contrast to unhabitable exoplanets. 

Our hopes for the project is to help boost awareness for the need of space exploration and to aid with the search / estimations for intelligent or unintelligent Extraterrestrial life with the best calculations and data possible.

The data contains detailled specifications on planet names, planet  hosts, number of stars, number of planets, discovery method used to find the exoplanet, discovery facility, orbital period (days), and the orbit semi-major axis.

Key factors we will be researching as well which have a long term effect on these planets are stellar radiation, orbital distance from the star(s), circular orbit, rotational axis, hydrogen abundance, and magnetic field.

General requirements for life to exist are
- Star is in a stable condition for an extended period of time (not close to a cosmic event)
- Far enough from massive planets to avoid collisions (asteroids)
- Within the habitable zone

This Data set was provided by NASA, Exoplanetarchive and the uploader or the set Shivam Bansal [here](kaggle.com)

Our data contains information and statistics regarding Planet Name, Planet Host, Number of Stars, Number of Planets, Discovery method used to find the planet, The year the discovery was made, The orbital period in days. Orbit semi-major Axis. 

Data Set information and statistics are all leading up to 2021. And the oldest data leading back to 1989. 

The purpose of the data set is to make a theoretical estimation based off calculations to determine what the approximate maximum and minimum amount of possible Habitable Exoplanets. This also includes another estimate regarding the possible amount of exoplanets possibly containing intelligent or unintelligent life.

The reason of the topic of choice is that this is an area of research which needs to be expanded to help aid in the furthering of the overall ability of exploration for the human age.

All data was collected by many different researchers / humans throughout history who recorded data through records, some digitilized and some already created straight onto the internet in the current technological years (up to date years (January 1, 1983+)). 
- This relates to the original start and creation of the internet.
